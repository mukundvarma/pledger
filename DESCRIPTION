Title: Plotting methods for differential gene expression data in R
Version: 0.0.0.9
Authors@R: person("Mukund", "Varma", email = "me@mukundvarma.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package provides various plotting utilities for pathway enrichment
    of gene expression data. It works with the output from the functions
    kegga() and goana() provided by edgeR, limma and others. Existing tools do
    a good job of visualizing the significance and/or the GO terms, but there are
    no tools which allow you to visualize the genes enriched within a pathway.
    This package aims to fill that gap with multiple user-friendly methods of
    visualizing the genes enriched within a pathway
